# Introducing the EigenLayer Ecosystem Network - your hub for collaboration and open innovation

We’re thrilled to announce the launch of the EigenLayer Ecosystem Network – an open repository meant to be used by teams within the EigenLayer ecosystem to support and create alignment with other teams within the EigenLayer ecosystem.

## Purpose of the EigenLayer Ecosystem Network Repository

This repository is intended as a transparent and evolving platform where projects within the EigenLayer ecosystem can list their addresses for others to use for airdrops. We frequently receive requests for airdrops and introductions between teams. This repository is our effort to allow that process to scale organically and permissionlessly across the ecosystem.


## How to Use the EigenLayer Ecosystem Network Repository

Projects are encouraged to update the repository with their information, including project details, contact information, and wallet addresses. We hope this provides an opportunity for projects to transparently associate and align with hundreds of other projects building within the EigenLayer ecosystem, including existing or prospective actively validated services (AVSs), Operators, EigenDA rollup partners, and liquid restaking projects.

4. Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message.

For token allocations, teams might consider using Splits (https://splits.org/) or a similar token allocation solution to lawfully enable ecosystem participation for individual contributors. Eigen Foundation does not own or control Splits or have any financial interest in the project or its intellectual property.

Due to concerns about conflicts of interest or the appearance of such conflicts of interest, Eigen Foundation’s policy prohibits any of its employees or dedicated service providers from individually claiming airdrops.

This repository in no way obligates you, requires, or suggests that Eigen Foundation or any other project listed above must or should get a share of any ecosystem allocations. This is just a public place for the sharing of information about EigenLayer ecosystem projects – nothing more.

In the spirit of infinite sum games, we believe the EigenLayer ecosystem can become greater than the sum of its parts by facilitating greater alignment and communication between projects and their contributors.

Happy collaborating and building!
